ChainGPT response: Certainly! Here is a secure, gas-optimized ERC-20 token contract with a burn function and an ownership pattern, ready for deployment.

---

### Overview

This contract implements the ERC-20 standard, providing all standard functions (`name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`).        
It includes a `burn` function, allowing any token holder to burn their own tokens, reducing the `totalSupply`.
Ownership is managed via an `Ownable` pattern, and the owner can also burn their own tokens (like any other holder).

- Uses Solidity ^0.8.0 (built-in overflow/underflow protection)   
- Optimized for gas efficiency
- Emits events for all state-changing actions
- Security best practices (e.g., checks-effects-interactions pattern, clear error messages, modifiers)

### Security Considerations

- **Overflow/Underflow:** Uses Solidity ^0.8.0, which has built-in checked arithmetic.
- **Zero Address Checks:** Prevents transfers, approvals, and burns to/from the zero address.
- **Ownership:** Only the owner can transfer ownership, but the burn function is open to all holders (including the owner).
- **Gas Optimization:** Uses `unchecked` blocks where overflow/underflow is impossible, and avoids unnecessary allowance updates when possible.
- **Event Emissions:** Emits standard ERC-20 events and a custom `Burn` event for transparency.
- **Error Messages:** All `require` statements include clear error messages.

**Ready for deployment on any EVM-compatible chain!**
